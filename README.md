# IOC11 Practice Module

Final project (IOC11) for EHU Skills Bootcamp in Cloud Computing and Data Analytics - cohort 3 (2022).

Students were tasked with choosing 1 of 3 project assignments and creating a short presentation, to be presented to a non-technical panel.

My project was based on analysing supermarket sales data using Python. I presented my findings in a PowerPoint document, timed to be narrated over a 6-minute duration.

My actual code was written as a Python file but I have transposed it into a Python notebook for display purposes.
